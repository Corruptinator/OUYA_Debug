# OUYA_Debug

![OUYA_Debug Icon](/ouya_icon.png)

A Godot Engine demo project to test run the OUYA controller on the OUYA console for debugging and testing purposes.

To control the Debug Demo: Press any buttons or tilt the joysticks on the OUYA controller to see which works. There is also an option to switch from "Correct" to "Broken" mode to see which controls are modified that makes it work but is still broken.

This can be done by pressing both the Left and the Right Joysticks in (L3 & R3) to switch between "Correct" and "Broken".

As I said this is for debugging and testing and it comes in really handy use for making sure there are no remaining bugs to make any Godot game projects functional on OUYA.

Additional Note: There is an InputEvent() output message for each button pressed or joystick tilted to inform which controlls were operated. HAVE FUN DEBUGGING OR PRESSING BUTTONS! :)
